# multiplayer-game

The app was built as a training in the backend field.<br>
It imitates a full online games service, but includes only Memory game.<br><br>
Main tools and technologies:
- Node
- Express
- Mongoose
- Socket.io

The main features of the app:
- Node.js server with Express view engine
- Built with MVC model in mind
- Exchanging data with Mongo database
- WebSocket connection between the server and the clients


Since I was focused mainly on the backend part in this project, I have some parts left for future improvement:
- Replace JS files with TS
- Add tests
- The app is supposed to be built in MERN stack, so add the missing 'R' :)
- Make the UI more fancy
